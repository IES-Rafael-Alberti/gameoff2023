![Kiwi in the Temple Ruins](https://ies-rafael-alberti.github.io/gameoff2023/assets/img/kiwi_teaser_lowres.jpg)
After a long journey, treasure hunter Kiwi arrives at the final destination of his adventure,carrying only his poncho and loads of cuteness. Kiwi traverses through the ominous temple ruins when he steps on a trap, a giant boulder falls from the ceiling and threatens to crush him! But luckily he manages to get inside the treasure room in time, not so luckily he gets trapped there in the process. In the center of the room he finds a stone table, with a cube-shaped treasure chest with some intricate designs on one sides. While looking around, he spots a small balcony carved into the squares that cover the sides of the chest, and he finds himself shrunk and standing on the chest's balcony! The intricate square tiles on the chest turn out to be a continuation of the dungeon, a final test stands between him and his treasure.

## Coming soon to the Game Off

We are very excited to introduce Kiwi, the main character of our next project. Our challenge is to develop this game in one month for submitting it to GitHub's Game Off 2023. Our game is a 3D dungeon crawler and platformer where the player has to interact in three scales: Normal and small and even smaller. The big picture lets you slide and rotate several tile pieces (which are rooms made in a modular design) to create paths and unlock mechanisms to get access to your precious treasure. But to unlock the chest itself, you'll have to traverse the tiles in the small view: Kiwi crosses the threshold to the chest's sides and while being small he can explore the rooms themselves. There is one more layer of smallness, that allows Kiwi to enter vases and other items inside the rooms, which he can do to gain access to keys and other utilities. Combining the three scales, normal (to put the room modules in the correct order), small (to traverse the platform dungeon within the chest) and smaller (to gain access to keys and ways to solve puzzles within the decor of the rooms) will allow Kiwi to succeed in his quest.

## Who is Kiwi?

Kiwi is a small green and yellow parakeet with a red beak and a love for treasure hunting. He wears a poncho and a utility belt. And has a tendency to collect shiny objects, thing that lead him to treasure hunting.
