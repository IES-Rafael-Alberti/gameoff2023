Hi there! We are pleased to share our first devlog where we will talk about the current state of our game project. 
After the first brainstrorming session, where we discused our ideas for our project for Game Off 2023 (being "Scales" the theme for the jam), we came with the idea of a recursive dungeon crawler / platformer 
where the main character (MC from now on) shifts its size to become small and smaller. Our artist had an idea of a bird-like cute treasure hunter on his mind and the next day he showed us his first sketch. 
We have to say that we falled in love with Kiwi, the treasure hunter parakeet, and we got down to work!

## Tools

For the dev we are using Unity for designing and programming the game and Blender for modelling characters. On the production size, we use GitHub projects for asigning tasks. GitHub pages give us this place to share our advances with you. Our communication tools are Discord and Telegram.

## First steps

On our first week of development, our programmers have prepared the platforming mechanics for the jump and movement using the test model that the artist did. 
The artist himself modelled the character and prepared his animations using Blender. Then our team implemented the animations on Unity and made the necessary adjustments. 
This is because in our firsts tests we noticed that Kiwi ran and jumped a little too slow (he felt like an astronaut in low gravity). 
Our programmers are also creating the size shifting mechanics with some test scenes.

## Art & design

As we said, Kiwi was designed by our artist and now he is pushing hard for our MC's world. As we said in our first post, Kiwi will arrive to an ancient ruin where he will find a treaasure and a magical artifact
that can make him small. Then he will have to beat a series of dungeons that will unlock the treasure seals. While he is big, he can modify the order of the rooms in the level itself via a slide-puzzle. 
While he is small, he will traverse the level to complete it in a platforming section. Every dungeon has a different theme and atmosphere, being the first one an Ancient Egyptian dungeon, and has different traps and interactible objects.
Our artist and Kiwi have a hard task ahead (but don't worry, they have been blessed by Horus :D)

## Last words

And what's for the second week? We can tell you that our programmers are working on the transition between the slider and platforming sections. By the way, they are preparing the main menu and the flow of the player experience. On the production side, we are preparing our social networks. We hope you like the logo that our artist has created.
