Day K is here! After loads of coding, drawing, modelling, typing and on-last-days-little-sleeping we have crossed the finish line. Kiwi is ready for his adventure! You can play the game at [our itch.io page](https://cryptidgrovestudio.itch.io/kiwis-adventure).
We are nervous, excited and eager to show our first game. It has been a harsh road, a month of challenges, doubts and issues that created difficulties to our quest... but we are proud to say the three words: we made it. 
It seems something easy to say at this point but at some moments we thought we weren't going to be able to say it. We have learnt of our mistakes, faced the boss of dissapointment, gained lots of exp and surely leveled up on our skills. Fortunately our work and clearity of ideas has led us to give players a finished oeuvre which we are proud of and that we would like to improve in the future with more levels and options. If it's better or worse it's something you players will have to say ;) 
We would like to thank our teachers from the Game and VR Dev Degree of Rafael Alberti School in CÃ¡diz for their help and continuos support, to family and friends that have tested the game and given some good advices and to all GitHub GameOff community for the warm welcome and feedback on the Discord server.
Greetings from:

* Main Programmer Boof
* Music Composer Aradian
* And the one who writes this words: Media Manager Deivid
Now it is time to let Kiwi fly! :D
